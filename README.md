**"Chrono-Reflective Singularity: A DDIC-Based Redefinition of Black Hole Interiors and Cosmological Nesting"**

## Abstract

This study introduces the concept of the *Chrono-Reflective Singularity (CRS)* within the framework of the **Density-Driven Internal Contraction (DDIC)** model. The CRS model proposes a paradigm shift in how singularities, event horizons, and nested cosmological layers are understood — not as physical breakdowns, but as temporally reflective lattice structures.

The core hypotheses include:
* **Microscale temporal boundaries** that reflect phase information inwards.
* **Nesting of cosmic structures** due to internal density gradients.
* **A new interpretation of black hole interiors** that avoids traditional singularities.

## Key Concepts

* **DDIC (Density-Driven Internal Contraction):** A framework for understanding curvature and singularity-free spacetime structures via internal density distributions.
* **Chrono-Reflective Lattice:** A geometric model that captures information echoes in spacetime akin to phase delay and memory.
* **Black Hole Reinterpretation:** Interior regions are defined not by breakdowns of physics, but by temporal topologies.
